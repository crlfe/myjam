# MyJam

MyJam is an experimental set of tools and libraries for building web games,
currently entirely incomplete and very unstable. My goal is to have something
lightweight, self-contained, and modular; with just enough features to quickly
build fun small-scale games that feel more polished than usual game jam fodder.

I'm currently working on adding...

* Fun, bouncy, themeable HTML+CSS components for 2D user interface.
* WebGL2 particle system, initially for effects on the 2D user interface.

And scheming for a future with...

* More examples! Of actually using the library! And documentation!
* WebAudio sound effect synthesis inspired by SFXR and clones.
* WebGL2 wrapper for tile-based 2.5D side-scrolling and isometric games.
* Migrate to WebGPU once it reaches baseline availability.
