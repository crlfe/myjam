    <h1>MyJam</h1>
    <p>
      MyJam is an experimental set of tools and libraries for building web
      games, currently entirely incomplete and very unstable. My goal is to have
      something lightweight, self-contained, and modular; with just enough
      features to quickly build fun small-scale games that feel more polished
      than usual game jam fodder.
