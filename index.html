    <h1>MyJam</h1>
    <p>
      MyJam is an experimental set of tools and libraries for building web
      games, currently entirely incomplete and very unstable. My goal is to have
      something lightweight, self-contained, and modular; with just enough
      features to quickly build fun small-scale games that feel more polished
      than usual game jam fodder.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      These pages use the MyJam libraries, so may be hard to understand until I
      wrote some documentation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="examples/buttons/">Buttons</a></li>
      <li>
        <a href="examples/particles-dom/">Particles rendered as DIV elements</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benchmarks</h2>
    <p>
      These pages use vanilla HTML, so should be easier to understand and
      reproduce. In theory I will get them packed into automated tests that can
      run in the cloud browser systems to get broader guidance of what
      techniques perform well, or not.
